# PortfolioAC

This webpage shows my portfolio. This will show samples of my work so far that I would like to share.

I will utilize flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables.

I will utilize placeholder images and names until I am able to change them to real applications I create later in the course.

You are presented with my name, a recent photo (or avatar), and links to sections for my about  me, my work, and how to contact me.

When you click the links, the UI will scroll to the corresponding section.

My first application will appear larger than the others. 

When you click images of the applications, it will take you to the relevant application.

You can resize the page for various screens and devices that my layout responds to.
